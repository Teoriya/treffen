## Problem Statement

In today's digital world, interviews and collaborative coding often face significant challenges:

1. *Internet Connectivity Issues*: Poor internet connectivity can disrupt interviews and collaborative coding sessions when sharing screens or communicating through video calls.

2. *Need for Separate Code Rooms*: Multiple interview panels and project teams require distinct spaces for collaboration and coding.

3. *Accessibility*: Not everyone has a laptop readily available, leading to a need for a solution that works on mobile devices.

4. *Scalability and Future Features*: Existing solutions may lack flexibility in adding new collaborative features.
